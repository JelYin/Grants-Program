# Enabling Decentralized and Trustworthy AI Services on Polkadot Blockchain

- **Team Name:** AI + Blockchain on Polkadot
- **Payment Address:** 0x9f50E023606420050b8BCe7d9100C7924e88dAB6
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2


### Overview
With the rapid development of AI, there are also rising issues, concerns and risks of centralized AI made and controlled by few tech giants in private. Therefore we believe the future of AI should be decentralized on blockchain to be transparent, democratic and reliable with public contributions and consensus. Blockchain can help AI have healthy, accountable and sustainable development in the long term. 

By combining Polkadot blockchain with AI, our project applies the decentralization of Polkadot blockchain to make AI services trustworthy. With Polkadot blockchain, we enable usersÂ to trace and protect the usage of their personal data in AI in a privacy-preserving way, and they can self-verify the whole process and results of their AI services to ensure their compliance and correctness. 

We also enable AI services to open the modeling and training of their AI for everyone in public to freely and equally improve and contribute including data, algorithms and computation power. All contributors can get corresponding returns according to their contributions to the earnings of those AI services, so the development of AI could become much faster, better and safer.


### Project Details

**Project Design:**

Specifically our project is divided into two parts. One part is to make AI trustworthy by protecting the privacy of personal data used for AI, tracing the source and usage of data in AI. We also enable AI services to become more transparent by opening their running process so people can self-verify the correctness and compliance of their computation results. 

Another part is to make AI more cooperative in public. Others can freely and equally contribute to AI and blockchain will record their contributions and distribute corresponding returns as incentives via tokens. Everyone can upload their privacy-preserving data for AI training, improve AI algorithms for modeling, and share their computing power for AI execution. As for the AI services involving public interests, everyone can also participant in their governance to reach consensus on their ethics, justice and inclusivity without bias or discrimination. 

Both parts are interconnected for a better AI services with user network, online content and applications. With users, data and resources in the service, AI could be applied and used in online services and applications. After that it incurs more valuable data to make AI better for more usage and applications, forming a positive cycle.

**Project Components:**

We will use privacy-preserving techniques like zero knowledge proofs to protect the privacy of the data and model in AI while they are still traceable, verifiable, and trustworthy. We ensure the privacy of users will not be revealed when their personal data are used for AI modeling and training. Online services can also make their AI fully open-source or not reveal any parts in a privacy-preserving way. Even though they choose to not reveal their AI models, they can still self-prove their correctness, reliability, and compliance to everyone. Everyone can also adjust and improve them based on their running results to make them better.

To address the bottlenecks of performance on blockchain, we will use the scaling techniques like layer 2 to put the huge workload of AI off-chain and raise the performance of blockchain. We also further optimize the allocation and distribution of AI resources and workload among all nodes on blockchain from data processing, AI modeling and training, to computation and execution.

To give each participant and contributor corresponding returns according to the value they make, we will design an effective incentive mechanism to count and reward the contributions of everyone to the AI on blockchain including data sharing, improvement of algorithms, and computation power. The earnings of AI services will be tracked and distributed among all contributors according to the value of their contributions as incentives.

In the project we will also provide the following deliverables:

- MVP version with the source code of front-end, back-end and smart contract
- Technical specifications with implementation details and parameters
- Project documentation core components, protocols, and architecture 
- Project research report with research paper and publications
- High-fidelity Prototype with user-friendly interfaces 
- Data models / API / SDK of the core functionality

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project can help Polkadot win a place in the coming era of AI. We will apply Polkadot blockchain into AI and also use AI to benefit the ecosystem of Polkadot. Specifically:

Empowered by AI, users can get better blockchain services in Polkadot, and they can contribute to AI with their data under authorization, privacy protection and incentives to help improve AI with more qualified data as inputs to get better AI services. They can also self-verify the execution of AI algorithms to trust the results of AI services on Polkadot. 

As for AI developers, everyone can help audit and improve AI algorithms like their modeling and training, and provide their computation resources to help run AI algorithms. Blockchain will track and record their contributions immutably. AI services will distribute their earnings with all contributors according to the value of their contributions to reward them corresponding returns fairly.  

AI services can also open its development and improvement to all developers in public. In this way AI can be improved and developed better in higher efficiency, quality, equality and inclusivity. Everyone can freely and equally contribute to AI services with better algorithms and new computation resources. The earnings of AI services will be fairly distributed among all developers according to the value of their contributions.
